## 1. Description
This app launches a short, 10 question quiz covering basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a UI which takes users through a main screen, into the main quiz. The quiz is timed and users are presented with a selection of multiple choice answers. Selecting the wrong answer will cause 10 seconds to be deducted from the timer, and a sound will be triggered, and a prompt will appear stating whether the answer was correct, or if not, what the correct answer was. If the user completes all questions, or the timer runs out, the quiz ends, and the user will be presented with a final score, which can be saved onto a highscore list derived from local storage. Scores will be kept unless manually deleted.  Users can replay the quiz via a button link.
